= Work Directory

The work directory is simply a place to store odds and
ends and from which to run experiments. Generally it is
broken down as follows:

  reference  - Files to keep around simply for reference sake.
               This could be someone elses code you are studying,
               or a document, etc.

  deprecated - Code that was part of the project but has been
               removed and which will ultimately be trashed,
               but kept on hand a while longer for reference sake.

  sandbox    - Experimental scripts, ususally this is not kept in the SCM.

  trash      - Files that can be deleted, but just in case are kept a bit
               longer for reference sake.
